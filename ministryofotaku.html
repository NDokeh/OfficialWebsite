<p>The Ministry of Otaku is a dedicated section of the Official Website featuring everything I know about Anime Culture in the United States, basically from Anime to Otakugraphy. It&rsquo;s also a Live Vlog/News/Talk Show/Game Streaming show on twitch.tv which has broadcasting on and off since Nov 3<sup>rd</sup> 2017.</p>
<p>It will also include my dedicated collection of Otakugraphy from almost every anime con I&rsquo;ve attended in the DC/MD/VA area since 2007 to the Present, in image and video.</p>
<p>My grandplan was to produce and create Otakumentaries for every anime convention I attended. Documentaries shot in a unique cinema verite style where the convention and events speak for themselves, where you will rarely see or hear me. Each with a unique visual presentation and titles. The Ministry of Otaku will be the primary home of the Otakumentaries.</p>
<p>Why a central database of Otakugraphy and Knowledge?</p>
<p>I have a great interest in anime culture as well, because I've been into anime in some shape or form since I was a child. Anime, video games, manga, cosplay, and the like. </p>
<p>Through this I've discovered the anime convention scene with my first one was Katsucon 2007. It was a one day stand, I spent most of the time documenting the convention and it's attendees and cosplayers. Ten years later I've been attending and documenting anime conventions in the DC/MD/VA area as a Cosplaying photographer. Or what I call myself The Cospalying Otakugrapger.</p>
<p>I've been photographing and videotaping anime conventions from opening ceremony to closing ceremony for ten years. 100s and 100s of Gigabytes of videos and 1,000s of photos of the anime convention scene. Only percentage of my footage is published to the public across the internet via YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and DeviantArt due to life, time, and financial constraints.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Otaku will also be the home of news related to the Otaku scene, videoclips, monologues, and actual video game footage via it&rsquo;s Twitch and Youtube channels.</p>

<p><u>The Live Show</u><p>

<p>The Ministry of Otaku is a LiveVlog/Video Game/Talk Show/Anime Streaming show that covers the following topics: Anime, Manga, Video Games, Visual Novels, Light Novels, Anime Conventions, Cosplay. It would be broadcast for a minimum of 3 hours from 7pm to 10pm or 8pm to 11pm or 9pm to 12mid. The entire thing will be presented in ultrawidescreen 21:9 or widescreen 16:9 and will be broadcast on Twitch.</p>
<p>The format will be as follows</p>
<p>Pre-show/Intro: This is where there will be a opening theme song from a anime/video game or music.</p>
<p>Monolouge/Vlog: This is where I talk about anything going on in my life or in the otaku or convention scene.</p>
<p>News: News and talk about the otaku scene (anime, manga, video games) and conventions. News sources can be from mainstream media, or from fan sites.</p>
<p>The main meat of the show will be the following</p>
<p>A. Talk Show: The talk show segment is me interviewing or talking about a subject with other people via Discord.</p>
<p>B Random Videos: Videos from youtube about otaku culture.</p>
<p>C. Website Viewings: Website viewings and readings related to the site</p>
<p>D. There will also by photography and video footage showings as well after conventions</p>
<br>
<p>Video Gaming: This is will be at the tail end of my sessions. Me playing a video game: It would be from one of the following: First Person Shooters, Racing, Action/Adventure. Currently it would be the following games until revenue comes in: PSO2, League of Legends, Overwatch, Battlefield, The Division, Destiny 2, Team Fortress 2, Borderlands Series</p>
<p>Overtime: Over time mode when after the credits come up. This the continuation of the video game segment, but for viewers still hanging around.</p>
<p>The screen interface will consist of a transparent digital over graphics icon, with the time in EST, CET, MST, and PST. There would be also a ticker scrolling news headlines that will be addressed in the news segment. The DOG, ticker, and time indicator will be removed in certain times of the broadcasts, especially during climatic moments of any gameplay session.</p>
<p>There would be two &ldquo;co-hosts&rdquo;: Bjorn the Bear and Skates the Sea Turtle. Bjorn is the teddy bear that sits behind him and Skates is the sea turtle that sits on his shoulder. There is a much explained in-lore entry on this: They're both magical familiars that Jkid allows them to control him as a puppet similar to Nohemon from Digimon Adventure. Bojorn controls Jkid's movements and Skates is the one controlling his mind. At the same time, &ldquo;Jkid's ultimate thoughts and words are his own.</p>
<p>Jkid himself will be costumed for each show, usually with his Otakugrapher costume/uniform, which consits of the MWPSB raid jacket from the anime Psycho-Pass and Chopper's Hat from One Piece anime/manga. Later he will appear with his own Ministry of Otaku uniform with his emblem. In some cases he will appear costumed as certain characters in certain games he plays.</p>
<p>Initially the video games will be from PC, but in the future it will feature video games from the PS2, Xbox, and Xbox 360 consoles.</p>
<p>There will also be live streams of conventions as it happens usually lasting an hour or two as the portable battery lasts.</p>
<p>There will be a Youtube channel along with the Twitch channel. It will feature anime/manga/video game analysis and reviews, focusing on ones from the 1990s and 2000s. Footage from Anime and Fan conventions. Reviews of products related to the scene. And gameplay Footage, which all be presented in 21:9.</p>
<p>The main set up will involve Two monitors and two desktops. A desktop for streaming/recording from the main computer I will work from and will record the audio from me and from the computer where I will playing video games from. The set up will include a streamdeck that will be downloaded to one of my tablets that will allow me to control the broadcast set up without using the keyboards and will have an emergency mute button in an event of racist outburst from the talkshow subjects. The two monitors consists of one for Twitch monitoring and one for the main work of video gaming and work.</p>
<p>The set up will also have a moving microphone with the Ministry of Otaku icon.</p>
<br>
<p>What is a Otakugrapher? A person who attends conventions as normal, but cosplays and actively documents the convention as they go:</p>
<p>I document and cover the following:</p>
<p>Cosplay Hall Photography: Photographing and videographing the Cosplayers in the Halls and in Photoshoots and Gatherings and all the fun stuff in between. Convention Documentation: Covering the Video Game room and their games including the arcade. Covering the dealers room and the products dealers, artist alley and the artists, and other areas of interest. Recording Panels of Interest: Panels of interests including Educational, in theme of the convention, or unique panels and events such as cosplay chess, quizzes. Interviews with cosplayers and regular attendees. Covering inside and outside the convention area.</p>
<p>Basically if I can sum it up. The documenting of an Anime Convention from a view point of a attendee.</p>
<p>If you ever saw me with a Tony Tony Chopper Hat with a blue raid jacket with two cameras attached to me, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
