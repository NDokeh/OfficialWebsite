<p>The Ministry of Otaku is a dedicated section of the Official Website featuring everything I know about Anime Culture in the United States, basically from Anime to Otakugraphy. It&rsquo;s also a Live Vlog/News/Talk Show/Game Streaming show on twitch.tv which has broadcasting on and off since Nov 3<sup>rd</sup> 2017.</p>
<p>It will also include my dedicated collection of Otakugraphy from almost every anime con I&rsquo;ve attended in the DC/MD/VA area since 2007 to the Present, in image and video.</p>
<p>My grandplan was to produce and create Otakumentaries for every anime convention I attended. Documentaries shot in a unique cinema verite style where the convention and events speak for themselves, where you will rarely see or hear me. Each with a unique visual presentation and titles. The Ministry of Otaku will be the primary home of the Otakumentaries.</p>
<p>Why a central database of Otakugraphy and Knowledge?</p>
<p>I have a great interest in anime culture as well, because I've been into anime in some shape or form since I was a child. Anime, video games, manga, cosplay, and the like. </p>
<p>Through this I've discovered the anime convention scene with my first one was Katsucon 2007. It was a one day stand, I spent most of the time documenting the convention and it's attendees and cosplayers. Ten years later I've been attending and documenting anime conventions in the DC/MD/VA area as a Cosplaying photographer. Or what I call myself The Cospalying Otakugrapger.</p>
<p>I've been photographing and videotaping anime conventions from opening ceremony to closing ceremony for ten years. 100s and 100s of Gigabytes of videos and 1,000s of photos of the anime convention scene. Only percentage of my footage is published to the public across the internet via YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and DeviantArt due to life, time, and financial constraints.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Otaku will also be the home of news related to the Otaku scene, videoclips, monologues, and actual video game footage via it&rsquo;s Twitch and Youtube channels.</p>
<p>What is a Otakugrapher? A person who attends conventions as normal, but cosplays and actively documents the convention as they go:</p>
<p>I document and cover the following:</p>
<p>Cosplay Hall Photography: Photographing and videographing the Cosplayers in the Halls and in Photoshoots and Gatherings and all the fun stuff in between. Convention Documentation: Covering the Video Game room and their games including the arcade. Covering the dealers room and the products dealers, artist alley and the artists, and other areas of interest. Recording Panels of Interest: Panels of interests including Educational, in theme of the convention, or unique panels and events such as cosplay chess, quizzes. Interviews with cosplayers and regular attendees. Covering inside and outside the convention area.</p>
<p>Basically if I can sum it up. The documenting of an Anime Convention from a view point of a attendee.</p>
<p>If you ever saw me with a Tony Tony Chopper Hat with a blue raid jacket with two cameras attached to me, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
