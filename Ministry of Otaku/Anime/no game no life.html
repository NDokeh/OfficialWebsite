As we approach the last 3'rd of the No Game No Life I want to share some facts I've discovered.

1. Sora is a underachiver while Shiro is a overachiver via no fault of their own. In Japanese society, despite the importance of education people who are really smart are targets of ijime. Underachivers will face pressure from their parents for not doing enough. As you can see, Japan has a treadmill education society, if for any reason you got screwed or screwed up by the system you get dropped off the treadmill. This explains why Sora quit after graduating high school and Shiro quit during elementary/middle school. While in any other society, they would be cared for or intergrated in such a way that they support of be supported by the community, in japan harmoney is often enforced by exclusion. 

There is a saying that the nail that stands up get's hammered down. The cases of Hikikomori NEETs are good example of the nail eventually bends, and breaks.

2. Without purpose from society that rejects them, they create their own world. Their world is their room and the various video games they play. The old world, if you watched the first episode, is "shitty game" for them. The new world before being summoned by Tet, is one that they have gained new purpose. (To understand what I'm talking about the meaning of purpose in life, what the Agent Smith explaination in Matrix Reloaded) In the new world of Disboard, they have a new purpose but it's a world that their ablities can be put to good use.

3. About tet himseld. The real reason why he gained the position as the One True God of Disboard after the Deus Wars can be summed up by the following by this quote"" The real reason why, as a God of games, his nature and personality inhibits him to actual fight. So while the Old Deus fought each other, he was too busy playing board games. Another aspect is that the real reason why he summoned the Blank siblings is thathe's not worthly of the title of the One True God, he's a child for fuck's sake, he wanted another person of in this case two people to lead the world for him.

Oh yes, his face is a reference to Card and Dice games. 

4. If Sora is by some a Gary Stu, why he has a communication disorder, and social anxiety.  Along with that, without his sister within sight or hearing distance he will crumble. The same with Shiro.

5. The Anime adatation is a love letter to game and anime otaku of the following: Laputa, Jojo, Ace Attornety, Skyri and Oblivion, and Eva.

6. The promise or "Blank will never lose" If you payed attention to the ED titles, you can visually see that a agreement was made between the siblings. It seems like that their relationship is based on video games. 

7. Parental adbandonment? If their parents abandoned them, how come they could afford all the computer monitors, electronics and food? Did their parents left them an inhertance? In the early volumes Light Novel (vol .1 or 2) their parents died. This triggered their closed in state of Hikikomori NEETs. Isolated from their real world, they create their own reality.

8. The ten oaths, despite active in use has loopholes. One major loophole is magic. Unless a rule prohinting mahicm, theyt will use magic to gain advantage. This explains how Inmanity only has one city because before the Deus Wars they used magic to fight directly, now they're using magic to cheal with almost absolute impunity.

9. Was Jibil actually waiting for a savior to lead them? Even after that savior defeated them.

10. There are actually lessions to be learned. Episode 1. Do not underestimate wolf in sheeps clothing. Respect the Unknown (episode 6), and make sure you set detasiled rules (episode 5).
