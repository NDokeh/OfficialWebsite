<p>What is the Otakubook?</p>

<p>The Otakubook was originally planned as a published portforllio of Otakugraphy over the year 2015. I was planning to post this as a book to show to photographers and the like, with the ultimate goal of getting published. But like all my publishing attempts, it has failed primarily because I never had the time or energy to do it. But with this personal website I'm actually able to publish the entire seleciton of photos.</p> 

<p>The Otaku book focuses more on the atmophere of the anime/fan convention scene, not individual cosplayers. This can range from photoshoot gatherings, in-character cosplayers, people having a random enjoyment out of a water fountain, people playing video games, or enjoying a concert, random fixurees and the like. Sometimes it attendees eating food or waiting in line for food or sitting around.</p> 

<p>It's the little things that if you piece them together that builds athomphere. The reason why I attend anime conventions is the athophere of people in the same interest that makes you want to forget about your short-term problems politics, real life, things that are outside of your control for at least a weekend.</p> 

<p>The photos you will see are ones from 2015.</p>
