<p>I got into video gaming when I was seven. I started with playing with my cousin's SNES playing Street Fighter 2: World Championship Edition in versus mode. I was not particularly good at that game at the time so most of the time I would just jump and kick with Ken or Ryu at the same time or mash buttons to defeat my cousin. And most of the time in these matches I lost. My actual first video game console was the Nintendo 64, and I got Mario Kart for my birthday. I played that game a lot because at the time I was obsessed with racing games.  My first non-racing game for the Nintendo 64 was actually Harvest Moon, a game that I actually finished one year-in game time--on one night, at the expense of my book report, which I managed to complete.</p>

<p>The next console I owned was an PS2 for Christmas. I did not got a memory card with the game, due to the Memory Card shortage at the time. So I managed to complete my first game: Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Without a memory card. That was the first and only time I did that stunt. I did got a memory card, a third-party one. But i did not use it, even though i tried it once. Eventually I did got a actual PS2 memory card,and I forgot where the original third party one went. The PS2 I have is actually the second one due to I fear the first one may have the condiction that causes the Disc Read Error condiction.</p>

<p>Later consoles I have include the Orignal Xbox (how I got it, I was bullied into to shut them up, which did not stopped them for harassing me for other reasons, that's a different story), the Game Boy Advance, the Nintendo DS, and the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>My previously owned a Nintendo 64, and a Game Boy Advance. I gave both to my brother since I already got other more powerful video game consoles. I gave it away to my special needs brother who actually enjoys it a lot more even though itâ€™s outdated.</p> 

<p>Now I currently own four consoles, two PCs, and plenty of video games, with plenty of unfinished ones.</p>
