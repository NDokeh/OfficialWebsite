<title>Fundraising Goals for Fundraisers</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>The followlling goals are for the two fundraising pages I'm maintaining to help me and my family:</p>

Gofundme:https://www.gofundme.com/help-jkid-get-out-of-debt/

Bitcoin cash:https://ndokeh.github.io/helpJkid/


<p>NEXT GOAL:$200 more (Up to $1200 more for a year): Allows me to rent a storage room from Uhaul to move all of my stuff that has been in my relatives basement for 8 years. Many of my stuff are of sentimental value to me because it represents the life that I wanted to have before my parents lost their jobs in 2014. Books, manga, video games, costumes, posters, video game consoles, electronics, clothes, comics. They're telling me that they want to fix the basement ASAP. In the event I can only rent a small room in a house or an apartment, I would not worry about my stuff being thrown away.</p>

<p>Certifications: A+ $250+ Linux+: $450+ Cloud+: $350+</p>

<p>With everyone having a Bachelors degree, the only way to stand out from the crowd is to have a IT certification. I had plans to get certifications after I moved out from my parents until it got derailed. The price include the cost of taking the exam and the book that allows the person to study for it. The Linux exam costs over 400 dollars because there are two exams that you have to take to get the Linux+ certification.</p>

<p>$300+: Pay off Best buy credit card, that I have been paying the minimum off for YEARS and it never went down.</p>

<p>$1000+ (up to $12000 for a year): Allows me to rent a room and pay ultities in the DC, MD, and VA area. If I can get a small room of my own, it will allow me to study, work on small jobs, play video games to stream publicly.</p>

<p>$1500+: I will be able to pay off my Perkins loan completely. I had plans to pay off my Perkins loan within 6 months of moving out of my parents. Now it had gotten close to becoming defaulted.</p>

<p>$2000+ (up to $12000 for 6 months): Allows my parents to stay in the house while they find people to rent out rooms without fear of being homeless or have power, gas, or water cut off.</p>

<p>$2100+: Allows me to use professional movers to move my stuff from my parents and relatives to my new home.</p>

<p>$2500+ (up to $30,000 for a whole year): Allows me to rent a one bedroom apartment and pay ultilites and cable/internet.</p>

<p>$3,000+ (up to 15,000): Will allow me to pay off one credit card that I'm totally behind in since I was laid off on October 2017.</p>

<p>$4,000+: Will allow me to pay the past due rent on the apartment we were forced to move out of because we could not afford it, despite paying the rent on time and giving proper notice.</p>

<p>$5,000+: Will allow me to set up a Gaming/Tech Studio with all the works: Including three Ultrawidescreen PC monitors, a Streaming PC, a Gaming/General Use PC, and a Linux Server for Podcast Production/Video Gaming Streaming/Movie production, plus a stream deck. Along with a comfortable chair due to my scorliosis.</p>

<p>$20,000+ I will start doing a weekly political and socio-economic commentary/research/analysis writing series: At least one commentary per week, with at least one of them related to bitcoin bitcoin cash and real economy (read, on the street) developments.</p>

<p>$25,000+ This will allow me to pay off my entire Federal Direct Student Loan that has been lingering for years since graduation.</p>

<p>$15,000+ I will start doing photography and videotography projects and allows me to travel the united states to this end and also allows me to attend and document anime/fan conventions. $15,000+ I will begin streaming sessions on twitch.tv, and fan commentary and analysis of anime, manga, video games, and otaku culture under the brand name &quot;The Ministry of Otaku&quot;</p>

<p>$15,000+ I will be able to write a non-fiction book in politics or in any other subject. Probably one about the media, internet culture, or socio-economics.</p>

<p>$15,000+ Allows me to travel to any one country in the world for a much needed vacation away from the slow decent of craziness and politically polarization of America: Canada, Taiwan, Britian, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Hong Kong.</p>
