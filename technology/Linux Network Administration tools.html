Ping - Tests that an internet host is reachable

sudo /etc/init.d/networking – allows you to stop, start, and retart as arguments,; controls network status.

dig

Dig makes DNS queries

syntax: dig TYPE domain.com

This lets you choose which DNS record to query for

There are several types to try but A will be the default if you use dig without specifiying an option.

There are other TYPES to try such as SRV, MX, TXT, AAAA…

You can also use dig to pick which DNS server to query. 

Syntax: dig @8.8.8.8 

Now the 4 8s are used as a example. It's useful if your systyem DNS is malfuctioning.

Dig +trace domain

traces how you domain gets resolved, starting at the root namedservers

dig -x makes a reverse DNS query – find which domain resolves to an IP

dig +short domain

dig prints lot of output, but with +short it justs prints the IP address/value of the DNS record. 

nslookup

infconfig is to adminsiter a tcp/ip network interface

ngrep - 

nftables/iptables – Allows you to set up firewalls and NAT

ip – Configures interfaces, routes, and more. Lets you view and change network configuration.

Ip Object command

OBJECT : addr, link neigh, etc

COMMAND: add, show, delete, etc

ip addr listening
ip route listening
ip netns
ip link
ip neigh
ip xfrm
ip -s link
ip route list

arp – Allows you to see your ARP table

ethtool

nc

wireshark 

netcat allows you to make a http request by hand. This is done via a file and can get a respone back with a bunch of HTML. 

This can be done to send hugge files over a locak netowkr quickly.

netstat/ss
Netstat is a tool for tracking network connections in the system. Often used for troubleshooting security and day to day network problems/ Netstat focus is more on network security. 

By default (with no parameters), netstat will provide all established connections for both
network and domain sockets. That means we’ll see not only the connections that are actually working
over the network, but also the interprocess communications

One purpose for the netstat command is to determine what services are enabled on your servers.

Do we need the service? The answer to this question is important. In most situations, you
should be able to disable a great number of services that start up by default. A stand-alone
web server, for example, should not need to run Network File System (NFS).
If we do need the service, is the default setting secure? This question can also help you
eliminate some services—if they aren’t secure and they can’t be made secure, then chances
are they should be removed. For example, if remote login is a requirement and Telnet is the
service enabled to provide that function, then an alternative such as SSH should be used
instead, due to Telnet’s inability to encrypt login information over a network. (By default,
most Linux distributions ship with Telnet disabled and SSH enabled.)
Does the software providing the service need updates? All software needs updates from time
to time, such as that on web and FTP servers. This is because as features get added, new
security problems creep in. So be sure to remember to track the server software’s
development and get updates as necessary.

tc

iw – set up wifi from the command line

traceroute/mtr

tcpdump – to dump traffic on a network. It captures network traffic and prints it out for you. 

Everyline of a tcpdump output represenats a packet.

Syntax

tcpdump option any port 53

example: tcpdump -n -i any port 53

-i

-a Prints out the packets contents

-n will will force tcpdump to always print out the IP address. Normally tcp will transalte the ip addresses to host names

-e This incluide ethernet information. This shwos you the MAC Address that the packet came from.


nmap – network mapper

nmap
The nmap program can be used to scan a host or a group of hosts to look for open TCP and UDP
ports. nmap can go beyond scanning and can actually attempt to connect to the remote listening
applications or ports so that it can better identify the remote application.

telnet – bad idea

network managger

whois  – Look up a domain

Syntax: whois

To query domain on given whois server whois -h whois.nic.cz seznam.cz

To check who wons current IP address/domain: who IP/whois domain

ssh – Secure Shell

route allows you to examine and confugre the hosts rotuing table

lsof

sysctl

socat

openvpn

Iptables lets you create rules to match network packets and to accept/drop/ or modify them. 

It's often used for firewalls or to do NAT.

in Iptables, tables have chains. And chains ahev rules

tables: filter, nat, mangle, raw, security,
chains: INPUT, FORWARD, PREROUTING, etc
rules: i.e. -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP

iptable-save:

This prints out all the iptables rules. You can restore them with iptables-restore, but it's also the easiest way to view all the rules

-j target

Every iptables rule has a target (what to do with matching packet). Options:

ACCEPT/DROP/RETURN
The name of an iptales chain
An extension (man iptables-extensions) Popular ones inclide: DNAT, LOG, MASQUERADE

tables have different chains:

filter: Input/output/forward
mangle:input/output/forward/prerouyting/postrouting
nat:output/prerouting/postrouting

It helps to learn when packets get processed by a given table/chain leg

fil;ter←-- OUTPUT = all locally genenrated packets)

you can match lots of packet attributes

-s: src ip
-d: dst ip

-p: tcp/udp

-i: network interfaces
