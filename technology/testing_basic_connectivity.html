<p>First use a ping command.</p>

<p>ping sends a simple ICMP packet to the system you name until you stop with a Control+C key combo. The number of tests can be limited with a -c(#) option.</p>

<p>Example: ping -c 5 hostname</p>

<p>Then use traceroute, which sends a series of 3 test packets to each computer between your system and a specified target system.</p>

<p>Example traceroute -n 10.1.0.4</p>
