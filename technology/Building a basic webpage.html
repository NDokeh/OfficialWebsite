<p>Writing any webpage is simple and easy. All you need to know are the following tags. html, head ,title ,body, h1 , and p  By using these tags, you can create any simple webpage. Like one I will show you.</p>

<p>First I will start by explaining each of the html tags. Second, I will show you how to place these tags, then finally how to check and proof read. Finally to place them into a micro-host.</p>

<p>I. The html tags</p> 

<ol>
<li>html - This starts the html code and allows the rest of the codes to be recognized and viewable </li>

<li>head - Heading: Allows other tags like title to be used</li> 

<li>title - Allows the title of the page to be seen at the top of the browser</li> 

<li>body - Allows text to be seen and codes such as h1 and p to be used </li>

<li>h1  - Heading allows the the level of how large the text using this tag to be bigger or smaller</li> 

<li>p  - Paragraph tag: Allows the actual text to be seen in the html page<li>
</ol>

<p> Now before I go on, it's very important that you replace the "" that are surrounded by teach html tag with <>, otherwise the your page will
  not be seen to the public.</p>
  
  
<p>II. First, open up notepad. You can do this by Right clicking any open space on the desktop screen, go down to New then highlight new notepad file. A notepad file will appear, type it in whatever or click anywhere outside the file so you can click on it and the notepad window will come up</p>

<p>The first thing you have to do is to type "html"</p>

<p>Then type in head and then "title" and put in the title of the page. Then after you put in the title, immediately type /title then press enter and then type </head></p>

<p>Then type in "body", then press enter and type "h1", then type in "introduction" then type "/h1".</p>

<p>Then press enter and then type in "p", then "hello world", then "/p". Press enter and then type in /body".</p>

<p>Finally to close the html page, press enter and type in "/html"</p>

<p>Then go to file, save as, and when the save screen appears, type in the helloworld.html.</p>

<p>III. Now we are going to place this file into a micro-host. One of them is github, which has GitHub pages. If you have not created a account, you can do so at Github.com, which is a easy process to create and get started.</p>

<p>Now for the actual creation of the GitHub page: 

<ol>
<li>Create a repository. There will be a green icon on the top right counter of the screen. Click on that. </li>
<li>Name your depository username.github.io, replacing username with your GitHub username. Make sure it's public, and allow github to initiate the page with a README file. </li>
<li>At your new repository, create a "index.html" page. This can be done by clicking the plus icon next to the repository name and typing the name directly in the field that appears. </li> 
<li>On the resulting page, place the your hello world html code inside the text editor. </li>
<li>Finally commit the index.html. At the bottom of the page, there is a text input area to add a description of your changes and a button to commit the file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations, you've just built your first GitHub pages site. It can be viewed at https://username/github.io. It will take 5 to 10 minutes for the page to go live. And 30 seconds for each update to go live. </p>
  
<p>That's all for now. See you.</p>
