<p>The purpose of being a Linux Systems Administrator is to optomise, 

<br />manage, and deploy system resources to serve and support 

applications <br />and users. The three tools of any Linux system admin 

are logs, <br />configurations, and documentation.</p>
<p>Logs are system logs</p>
<p>Configurations are settings</p>
<p>And Documentation are Standard Operating Procedures, and knowledge 

base <br />sections that you look up.</p>
<p>The fourth tool is the command line.</p>
<p>Installing linux is surpriseling easy. Especially easy if you choose 

to <br />use virtual box, which is a free piece of software. I would 

recommend <br />using CentOS or Ubuntu to practice linux 

administration.</p>
<p>What ever you do. If anyone suggests that you install gentoo: DON'T. 

<br />JUST SIMPLY DON'T.</p>
<p>The most common commands for linux would be the following:<br />cd, 

ls, cp, mv, rm,chmod,clear, pdw, kill, ifconfig, grep, find</p>

<h>LAMP Stack</h1>
<p>LAMP isthe foundation of Linux based servers. LAMP servers work 

great <br />with Drupal and Wordpress.<br />Linux - Foundation of a 

LAMP Stack Server<br />Apache - Webserver<br />MySQL - Details to be 

quared by scripting<br />PHP - Web app and PHP and python/perl<br />And 

there are two ways to install a LAMP server. The First one is using <br 

/>taskel and the second one is to install each component of the LAMP 

<br />stack seperately.<br />---------<br />The first one is the taskel 

option, and it's done in three steps<br />sudo apt-get update<br />sudo 

apt-get install tasksel<br />sudo taskel - This step will giove you a 

prompt check for the LAMP <br />server and all you need to do is to 

select "OK"<br />----------<br />Installing Apache, mysql-server<br 

/>sudo apt install apache 2<br />sudo apt install mysql-server <br 

/>sudo apt install php pear php-fpm php-dev zi<br />sudo apt install 

php-curl php-xml rpc<br />Researt server via sudo service apche2 

restart (however the server will <br />restoart automatically)<br 

/>Check apache via https://localhost/<br />check php via two ways<br 

/>1. executing any pp file from within /var/</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2. php -r 'echo" "\n\n Your PHP installation is working fine \n\n

\n"</p>
