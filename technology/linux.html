<p>The purpose of being a Linux Systems Administrator is to optimize, manage, and deploy system resources to serve and support applications and users.  ------------ Basics</p>

<p>The four tools of any Linux system admin are logs, configurations, documentation, and the command line</p>

<p>Logs are system logs</p>

<p>Configurations are settings</p>

<p>And Documentation are Standard Operating Procedures, and knowledge base sections that you look up.</p>

<p>The fourth tool is the command line. ------- Installing Linux</p>

<p>Installing linux is surprisingly easy. Especially easy if you choose to use virtualbox for Windows, which is a free piece of software. I recommend using CentOS or Ubuntu to practice linu administration.</p>

<p>Whatever you do. If anyone suggests that you install gentoo: DON'T. JUST SIMPLY DON'T.</p>

<p>Most command commands</p>

<p>The most common commands for linux would be the following: cd:  ls: cp: mv: rm: chmod: clear: pdw:  kill: ipconfig: grep:  find: --------</p>

<p> LAMP Stack</p>

<p>LAMP is the foundation of Linux based servers. LAMP servers work great with Drupal and Wordpress. LAMP stands for the following</p>

<p>Linux - Foundation of a LAMP Stack Server</p>

<p>Apache - Webserver</p>

<p>MySQL - Details to be quared by scripting</p>

<p>PHP - Web app and PHP and python/perl</p>

<p>And there are two ways to install a LAMP server. The First one is using taskel, and the second one is to install each component of the LAMP stack separately.</p>

<p>The taskel option</p>

<p>The first one is the taskel option, and it's done in three steps</p>

<p>sudo apt-get update</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install tasksel</p>

<p>And finally, sudo taskel - This step will give you a prompt check for the LAMP server and all you need to do is to select &quot;OK&quot;</p>

<p>Installing the LAMP Stack manually:</p>

<p>Installing the LAMP Stack manually is done via the following linux command line commands:</p>

<p>Installing Apache, mysql-server</p>

<p>sudo apt install apache 2</p>

<p>sudo apt install mysql-server </p>

<p>sudo apt install php pear php-fpm php-dev zi</p>

<p>sudo apt install php-curl php-xml rpc</p>

<p>Then, restart the server via sudo service apche2 restart (however the server will restoart automatically)</p>

<p>Check apache via https://localhost/ check php via two ways</p>

<p>1. executing any pp file from within /var/</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2. php -r 'echo&quot; &quot;\n\n Your PHP installation is working fine \n\n \n&quot; </p>
