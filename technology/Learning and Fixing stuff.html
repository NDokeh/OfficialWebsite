Learning and fixing stuff

Learn fundamental concepts. Figure out which ideas are the most important, and learn them

Do experiments

Read books. Even just reading a few chapters of a good book can help a lot. Like Linux kernal development by Rober Love and Networking for System administrations by Michael Lucas

Work wth Linux in your job.

If you do not understand something, dig in.

Don't forget it takes a long time.

Learn stuff. You should be familiar with setting up and configuring samba, apache, nginx, sendmail, postfix, courier, dovecot, openldap, mysql, postgresql at a minimum. You need to know TCP/IP well, and be able to configure iptables. You should install openbsd and learn to setup pf and ipsec so you can use it for firewalls/loadbalancers/routers instead of linux which sucks donkey dicks. And unlearn your bashisms. Go back and fix all your scripts to work correctly with /bin/sh on debian or a BSD.
