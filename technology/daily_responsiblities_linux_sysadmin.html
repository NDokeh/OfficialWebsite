<p>The *average daily routine of a Linux Systems Administrator will be as follows.</p>
<p>1. Check the status of all servers. This is called a health check. A health check will check the status of the following: Cpu,Memory ,processes,services &amp; diskspace of the servers. At the same time you will check on emails on important news from you co-workers and management.</p>
<p>2. Performance monitoring of the cpu &amp; swap memory</p>
<p>3. File system usage monitoring &amp; extension</p>
<p>4. User credentials, logon, group and security maintenance</p>
<p>5. Troubleshooting like server crashes ,reboots, hardware problems</p>
<p>6. Network problems on the server.</p>
<p>7. Maintaining print queues or printers attached tothe server.</p>
<p>8. Look for any TSR's orTechnology Service Request and ARMS or Access Rights Management System requests to unix team. This will be done via a ticketing and asset management system such as Remedy. Usually they're p[pen calls or tickets for Troubleshooting (Trouble tickets), service requests, , and change requests.</p>
<p>9. General requests for extending the file system &amp; creating new mount point user administration</p>
<p>10. If a major incident happens like server rebooted by itself any hardware component failed, you need to inform your co-workers or staff that are on the system</p>
<p>11. Check the backup report (scheduled by crontab and ctrl-m). Backup types can be by BCV/Snap/Tape/D2D. If any client backup fails, the backup has to be re-run if it's a hot backup. Otherwise, you have to inform the database or application team to re-run the backup</p>
<p>12. Perform and write scripts that are either one time or automated for statuses, patching and updating.</p>
<p>13. Check statuses for alerts and warnings</p>
<p>14. Daily check on server room</p>
<p>15, Work on technical manuals or on knowledge desk articles.</p>
<p>*Average: Because there will be emergency situations as server crashes, downtime due to downed servers or hard drive crashes, and emergency patches to counter day-zero security breaches and exploits.</p>
