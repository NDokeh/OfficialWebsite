<p> Unix permissions are divided into three sections. User, Group, and Others or UGO</p>

<p>Under each group there are three permissions read, write, and execute or rwx.</p>

<p>You can find and show permissions of each file using ls -l or for a particular file: ls -l [filename.ext]</p>

<p>File permissions are 12 bits. Since they&rsquo;re each set up as binary code. For example 110 in binary is 6 while 100 is 4. So you can easily dial a file permission setting like so via chmod. </p>

<p>Examples:  777 &ndash; rwx for all.  755 - rwx for owner, and rx for group and other.  744 &ndash; rwx,r,r: All permissions for owner, with read only for the rest And 444 r,r,r Or read only</p>

<p>Note that the default permissions for files and directories are 644 and 755 respectively.</p>

<p>And there are two versions of how read, write, and execute affect files and directories.</p>

<p>There are other commands to change file and folder permissions.</p>

<p>chmod to change permissions chgroup to change group permissions chown change ownership and group ownership of a file.</p>

<p>There are three special versions of permissions</p>

<p>setuid: Users who access the file is granted access permission of the owner of the file You can tell that setuid is active by looking for the s in rws. This means that the program always runs as root, no matter who started using the command. </p>

<p>Setgid: Similar to setud, but the process is changed to owner of the file. Setgid does three different unrelated things for executable, directories, and regular files. </p>

<p>Stickybit: A special permission that protect the files within a public writable directory  Stickybit permission set the shared directory, user can create a files or directory  But only by owner of the directory can modify or delete.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that setuid and setgid are potential security risk, but stickybit is a security boost. </p>
