<p>University of Maryland</p>
<p>The University of Maryland is a University in College Park, MD. I've attended the university from 2006 to 2012. Four of those years as a student in residence and the remainer as a communter student. Many things happened there that I've photographed and videotaped throughout the years I've been there. So many, but I never had the time to upload it onto my YouTube page.</p>
<p>All of it is in one of my 4 WD hard drives. Maybe I'll upload them all when I have the time. Probally never.</p>
<p>You can view some of the footage here.</p>
<p>----<br />Terpzone Arcade</p>
<p>What was known was the UMD was one of the few universities that had their own arcade section. There was the following games: House of the Dead 4, Into the Groove, Capcom vs Marvel 2, Time Crsis 2, Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3.</p>
<p>They replaced the arcade cabinets with video game consoles.</p>
