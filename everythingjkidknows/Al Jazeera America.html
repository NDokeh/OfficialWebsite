Al Jazeera America is a long channel in the United States due to the lack of real hard news, especially domestic news in the United States. CNN has already gone sensationalistic tabloid, MSNBC and Fox News are partisan. AJA has done more to news television than what has been done recently by the big three in decades. Sadly they made several mistakes. First they  immediate kowtow to cable television channels by shutting off live and video feeds of programing. 
In some cases, programs in Al Jazeera English were effectively unavailable at all, since they do not broadcast on AJA. The ones that do broadcast on AJA like witness, people and power, and listening post are often unpromoted and shoved into the weekend. In some cases, unessary viewer advisories are shown, some cases without warning. 

While domestic news is important, what AJA lacked is real world news

Al Jazeera America programing is frequently added same commercial breaks as the the big 3. Programs orginally added from AJE have additional advert breaks. This is entirely unnessary the sad truth is advertisers do not care about quality and viewership, they only care about eyeballs

Why the big three are profitable? Sensationalism, hardnews while profitable don't attract advertisers. This is unlikely in the case of Europe where tjey have a long tradition of public service broadcasting. AJE on the other hand only has one commercial break every 30 minutes, which they still do to this day.

What is also worse that they added the soundbyte mentality while adding in hard news. PEople want to see more than 5 seconds of what he is saying.

 AJA could have succeeded was break free from cable television. The WWE network did that for about 9 bucks a month... they had VOD and live coverage of everything they have to offer in wrestling. AJA could have not put everything online and live streams dedicated online: AJA, AJE and the al jazeera network channels for about $9. It was the same price as Netflix. Plus they would  have true freedom. It's not that hard, you may have to cut contracts from Time Warner and Comcast to do it, and here's why: comsumers are not willing to pay or subside reality tv garbage for a channel they actually want. They don't care about what if you are bored or like the program, they want what they need.

AJA never had the same ads as CNN and MSNBC has, and they should have broken free of it.

But it was too late, the 2014 Oil glut happened and Qatar bottomless pit of money was no longer bottomless, and they could not support Al Jazeera America anymore. 

Al Jazeera America died, and thus the last great hope of American journalism died with it.
