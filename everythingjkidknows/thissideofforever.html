<p>Roberta Flack's this side of forever was a song that was first 

debuted as a ending theme of Sudden Impact, the 4th and in my opinion, 

the real final movie of the Dirty Harry film series. (The fifth installment "The Dead Pool" was merely a regular installment instead of a final film)</p>

<h1>Lyrics</h1>

<p>Wounded I fell from the sky<br />You fed me right from your hand<br 

/>Once a small frightened dove<br />Now the falcon on your glove<br 

/>Strong enough to fly should you command me</p>
<p>But let me stay,<br />Please try to get to know me<br />I can find 

my way<br />To loving you will show me<br />And then one day<br />Just 

this side of forever<br />You might hold me<br />So I never fly 

away</p>
<p>Oh I need you</p>
<p>But if you ask me to leave<br />And I should cling to your sleeve<br 

/>Then just wave me goodbye<br />And away I will fly<br />To circle 

high above you when I leave you</p>
<p>But let me stay,<br />Please try to get to know me<br />I can find 

my way<br />To loving you will show me<br />And then one day<br />Just 

this side of forever<br />You might hold me<br />So I never fly 

away</p>
<p>Let me stay,<br />Try to get to know me<br />I can find my way<br 

/>To loving you will show me<br />And then one day<br />Jut this side 

of foever<br />You might hold me<br />So I never fly away</p>
<p>Let me stay,<br />Try to get to...</p>

<h1> Official Release </h1>

<p>The only official release was in CD cassete and in LC</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the song has never been released in any 
digital format including iTunes.</p>
<p>The closest thing to a official release of her song is in Lalo Schifrin The Dirty Harry Anthology. It 
matches the same melody but with a different jazzy tune than the 
original electronic guitar used.</p>
