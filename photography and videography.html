<p>I've been a photographer since the May 15th, 2005. Using my first camera, which was a Kodak I got for my 2005 birthday, my first photos was at the Morgan Boulevard Metrorail Station.At the time I had a small memory card of about 64MB so I was not about to make much pictures.</p>

<p>There during my time I took pictures of the subway trains and stations. At that point, I took pictures of what else that interests me. My photography as a hobby would took off be when I got into college. Where I just took pictures of any thing that would interest me. When I was at the University of Maryland where I took pictures of the scenery, buildings, interior, major events during my residence there from 2006 to 2012. I also took photos of College Park and the surrounding area.</p> 

<p>I was there at the Obama inauguration in 2008. I've covered political vigils, marches and events periodically.</p>

<p>I have plenty of photos during my time in the United Kingdom: London, Nottingham, and Southend-on-Sea. This same habit was expanded to when I got a camcorder in 2008. I've taken photographs and videos in Maryland, Virginia, DC, Baltimore, New York City as a street and candid photographer.</p>

<p>Cosplay and convention photograpy was to be my next step and that started when I first attended Katsucon 13 in 2007. I've documented various fan and anime conventions in the DC Metropolitan area including Katsucon, Anime USA, Otakon, and MAGFest as a Otakugrapher/Cosplaying Hall Photographer.</p>

<p>Most of my photos I've taken have never been shown or uploaded to the public due to time, life, financial constraints. This is practically a small portion of all the photos and videos I've done for the past thirteen years.</p>
